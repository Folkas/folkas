# [Start Bootstrap - Stylish Portfolio](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/stylish-portfolio/)
# Let's start

The goal of this page is to describe my interests in data analysis.

##
The repository contains the Lithuanian Parliamentary election 2020 dataset provided by [the Central Electoral Commission of the Republic of Lithuania](https://www.vrk.lt/en/home). I'd like to research voter behavior in different municipalities (Vilnius, Šiauliai and Kelmė). My theory is that voters' attitudes depend on the size of their municipality.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.
